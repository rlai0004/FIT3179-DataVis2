                <p>Welcome to our journey through the academic world of 2023, where we delve into university rankings
                    and student statistics.</p>
                <p>The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2023 include 1,799 universities across 104
                    countries and regions, making them the largest and most diverse university rankings to date.

            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p>These rankings are based on 13 carefully calibrated performance indicators that measure an
                    institutionâ€™s performance across four areas: teaching, research, knowledge transfer, and
                    international outlook.
                </p>
                <p>Let's explore the data and see what we can find out about the world of academia in 2023.

                    <h2>Exploring Global Student Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Before delving into the world of university rankings, let's take a closer look at the global
                        student population and how it is distributed across countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>As evident in the accompanying bubble chart, <b>there's a noticeable correlation between the
                            number of students and universities in a country</b>, as one would logically expect.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Most countries, particularly smaller countries with populations less than 200 million, tend to
                            have a proportional number of students and universities</b>, with up to 1 million students
                        and 60 universities.</p>
                    <p>However, there are some countries that stand out from the rest:</p>
                    <li><b>The United States of America boasts the highest number of universities (179) and students (4
                            million)
                            globally</b>, despite its smaller population compared to countries like China and India.
                    </li>
                    <li>The United Kingdom and Japan have a substantial number of universities (over 150) but not as
                        many students in comparison.</li>
                    <li>Russia and India also have around 100 universities each but only about 1 million students
                        enrolled.
                    </li>
                    <li>Egypt, on the other hand, has a relatively high number of students (2.6 million) with a
                        comparatively lower number of universities (40).</li>
                    <p>The choropleth map below provides another useful view of student distribution around the world,
                        normalising the number of students in each country by its population.</p>

                    <p>From the choropleth map, we can see that <b>the countries with the highest student-to-population
                            ratios are Greece, Iceland and Australia, each with over 300 students per 10,000 in
                            population.</b></p>
                    <p><b>Generally, student enrollment per capita seems highest in western nations located in western
                            Europe, Oceania and North America </b>. Asian and African nations generally have lower
                        student-to-population ratios, with some exceptions such as Japan, Turkey and Egypt.</p>

                    <h2>University Ranking Distribution by Region</h2>
                    <p>Now, let's examine the global distribution of university rankings. As evident from the two charts
                        to the right, <b>Oceania stands out with a median rank of 298</b>, and nearly all of its
                        universities boasting rankings better than the global median. Remarkably, <b>80% of
                            universities in Oceania are positioned within the top 500 globally.</b></p>
                    <p>Apart from Oceania, both the Americas and Europe exhibit similar ranking distributions, with a
                        significant presence of universities at the top echelons of the university ranking leaderboard.
                        <b>Approximately 35% and 37% of universities in the Americas and Europe, respectively, secure
                            places within the top 500 globally.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>In contrast, Asia and Africa share comparable ranking distributions, with a smaller percentage of
                        universities ranked in the top 500 globally (approximately 10% and 15%, respectively). Instead,
                        a more substantial proportion of universities in these regions falls within the range of ranks
                        1,001 to 1,500.</p>

                    <h2>University Size Distribution and its Impact on Rankings</h2>
                    <p>Now, let's explore the distribution of university sizes around the world and understand how it
                        influences university rankings. Focusing on the top 500 universities globally, we find that the
                        <b>Fmajority of these institutions have a student population of less than 40,000, with a median
                            size of just over 22,000 students.</b>
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Surprisingly, there doesn't appear to be a strong relationship between university size and
                            their global rankings.</b> However, when adjusting the slider on the histogram and heatmap
                        to view more universities, it becomes evident that <b>very large universities tend not
                            to perform well in global rankings.</b></p>
                    <p><b>The distribution hints that maintaining a relatively moderate size, with a range of 10,000 to
                            40,000 students, is often the optimal choice for most universities.</b> This is further
                        emphasized
                        by the fact that <b>36 of the top 50 universities fall within this size range</b>.

                    <h2>International Students and Their Impact on University Rankings</h2>
                    <p>Finally, let's delve into the distribution of international students around the world and explore
                        its connection to university rankings. Examining the scatterplots, <b>we observe a notable
                            correlation between the percentage of international students and
                            university rank in most regions</b>. This intriguing relationship opens the door to several
                        interpretations.</p>
                    <p>It may suggest that universities with a strong international outreach tend to perform better in
                        university rankings, emphasizing the importance of global diversity. On the other hand, it might
                        also indicate that students are naturally drawn to universities that have already established
                        strong positions in rankings.</p>
                    <p>This relationship prompts a compelling question: <b>Can universities enhance their rankings by
                        investing more in international outreach?</b> Further analysis could shed light on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Of particular interest is the <b>distinct profile of African universities. They stand out by
                        maintaining a significantly lower proportion of international students</b> compared to universities
                        in other regions. <b>All African universities in our dataset have less than 20%
                            international students</b>, setting them apart in this aspect. This is likely due to
                        external
                        factors and reasons that students around the world are less interested in studying in Africa -
                        another area of interest for further exploration.</p>
